            <h2>About BINBANG12</h2>
            <p>I'm Callum Haley, an aspiring lawyer or computer scientist. I have a passion for coding and problem-solving, and I'm currently learning Spanish and building my own coding portfolio. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and I enjoy taking on new challenges. When I'm not coding, I'm reading or working on various personal projects.</p>

                        <h3>Crazy Eights: A Python Command-Line Game</h3>
                        <p>Crazy Eights is a classic card game where players race to get rid of all their cards by matching numbers or suits with the top card of the pile. With special rules for eights, this command-line version offers a fun and engaging challenge for 2 or more players, featuring simple commands and a text-based interface.</p>

                    <h3>Minimalist 3D Bedroom</h3>
                    <p>This is the result of my first attempt at creating a 3D website. I used A-Frame, a powerful framework built on HTML, to design an interactive, minimalist 3D bedroom. With A-Frame, users can explore and navigate the space, allowing them to walk around and inspect the environment from different angles.</p>

                    <p>This card symbolizes a project that's currently, in the initial planning phase. An idea awaiting further development with evolving concepts and features as work moves forward. The specifics of the projects functionality and design will be determined over time as it continues to take shape. A project, in the making! </p>
